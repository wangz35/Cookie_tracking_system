Behavioral Analysis of Users in Response to Cookie Consent Prompts:Designing a system and then collecting data. Analyze the behavior of users when they are presented with cookie consent prompts on websites

A cookie is a small piece of identifying information that saves in your broswer, including saving ur session when log in, take note of location without using gps function.
So cookies are not bad things but useful functionalities that can make the website work more perfectly.
Among all the cookies, we have first party cookies which originated from the website you visit, and third party cookies that cause ad tracking. These cookies are placed by the ads showing the side of website and tracking you around on the web about your activity.

ad tracking can be very uncomfortable for some people so we have the EU cookie laws. It basically prevent websites to place cookies in your pc only if you click the agree button.

But this law can sometime be not that effective. Usually we can see 'more options' button in the popup cookie consent besides "Accept all".
And if you click on the less obvious button, you will be bring to a bunch of other options for disabling specific types so say it may take more than 20 seconds to configure all the options where you just want to spend like 5 seconds on the website in looking for the item you want.

In the project, we are aiming to find out how and why cookies are important and do a research on the user behavior on cookies, and list the potential solutions.
